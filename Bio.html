		<P>
		
		I studied at IIT on the South side of Chicago, earning my bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering. It was a challenging program where I was able to delve deeply into technical topics, challenging myself with difficult material, and growing in my ability to conceptualize physics abstractly and mathematically.  After graduating, I did not get an engineering job. Jobs were few and far between in 2010, and I was unskilled at job searching. In order to keep making payments on my student loans, I went back to work at a store I had worked for during high school and college breaks. It was a stressful experience to work hard for 4 years earning an engineerring degree, only to be loading rock salt and topsoil into people's trunks, utilizing none of the skills I had studied. In this time though, I became more humble, and I learned more about myself than I may have otherwise. By observing what I judged to be poor management, I became angry, which fueled my desire to one day be in the same position, but define the role and my actions in better ways. I was driven to be a motivator, a teacher, a protector, both for the benefit of my future team, and for the satisfaction that I had grown and contributed to other's daily lives. In the fall of 2012 I quit my job. My student loans were paid off, I was unhappy, and I was becoming self-destructive because of my job's effect on my mental state. This led me to my next job in automotive manufacturing. There I worked diligently on my communication, time management, and planning skills. After 2 years I was promoted to supervisor and moved from night shift to day shift. 6 months later I was promoted to assistant manager. I feel validated by my quick ascent, but more significantly, I draw gratitude from the challenge of my current and most difficult position. By being expected not only to manage, but lead, I have been driven to grow moreso than any of my prior work or education. The stress and work that I have endured over the last 2 years for the sake of my department and my team has done so much to shape me into who I am now that I cannot imagine another reality.
